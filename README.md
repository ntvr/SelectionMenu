## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements
- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Swift 4.0+

## Installation

### CococaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
gem install cocoapods
```
To integrate SelectionMenu into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SelectionMenu'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```shell
$ pod install
```

It is useful to specify also dependency version like `pod 'SelectionMenu', '~> 0.2.0'`, but before first major release the API will be unstable anyway.

### Carthage
Carthage is now unsupported.

### Swift Package Manager
Swift Package Manager is now unsupported.

## Usage

### Basic setup
To add SelectionMenu to your view just create any view implementing `protocol MenuButton`. There are already few implemented for you: `LabelMenuButton, UIButton`.

```swift
override func loadView() {
	super.loadView()
	
	let button = LabelMenuButton(text: "Menu")
	// Here you can do styling of the menu button
	
	let selectionMenu = SelectionMenu(menuButton: button)
	view.addSubview(selectionMenu)
	self.selectionMenu = selectionMenu
	
	// Setup selectionMenu layout as you would for the button
	// Selection menu inserts platform beneath itself 
	// and presents its content there
	// Therefore it needs to be on top
}
```

### Menu content
As for setting up the menu content I suggest creating new object implementing `protocol SelectionMenuDataSource` and `protocol SelectionMenuDelegate`. Then you can define your own protocol to communicate with containing `UIViewController`.

But on the other hand there is already prepared `StaticMenuDataSource`, which can get you up and kicking in no time. 

```swift
// You cannot assign the datasource directly, because it is weak reference and data source would get released immidietaly
// So you have to store it into strong referencing property
self.menuDataSource = StaticMenuDataSource(sections:
            (type: .singleSelection(selected: 0), [.text("A"), .text("B"), .text("C"), .text("D")]),
            (type: .multiSelection(selected: [1, 3]), [.text("I"), .text("II"), .text("III")]),
            (type: .buttonSelection, [.text("üòÄ"), .text("üôÇ"), .text("üòê"), .text("üôÅ"), .text("üòû")])
        )

self.selectionMenu.dataSource = self.menuDataSource

```

Or you can use predefined SelectionMenu which also creates the button for you:
```
let menu = SelectionMenu.orangeAccent
view.addSubview(expandableMenu)
self.menu = menu
```

### Styling
You can change the appearance of whole collection or single elements using two protocols `SelectionCollectionStyling` and `SelectionElementStyling`.

Both of these protocols contain single method which gets called in appropriate times to apply necessary styles.

You can implement your own styles or use already implemented. Some of them conform to both protocols and thus can be used for both properties at once.

```swift
selectionMenu.elementStyle = SelectionElementStyle(
	circular: true,
	selectedFgColor: DayAndNight.darkNavy,
	selectedBgColor: DayAndNight.tangerine,
	deselectedFgColor: DayAndNight.daffodil,
	// I suggest clear background color to be able to differentiate selected elements easier
	deselectedBgColor: .clear)


selectionMenu.collectionStyle = SelectionCollectionStyle(
	circular: true,
	foregroundColor: .black,
	backgroundColor: .white)
```

You can even use more styles at once using CompositeStyle.

```swift
selectionMenu.collectionStyle = CompositeStyle(collectionStyles: [collectionStyle, ShadowStyle.dark])
```

### Layout
In case of layout you have plenty of options, but first you have to decide between two options. Those mean automatic layout which looks for most available space and manual layout that just follows what it was told to.

- If you want to use `AutomaticMenuLayout` you do not have to do anything as this is already used.
- If you want to use `ManualMenuLayout` you have to instantiate it first.

```swift
menu.collectionsLayout = ManualMenuLayout(
	// Center of the menu button to center of first collection
	horizontalAlignment: .centerToCenter,
	// Top of the menu button to bottom of first collection
	verticalAlignment: .topToBottom(direction: .up)
)
```
